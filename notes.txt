How to create tarball that behaves same (no directory structure, name, ...) like original dji_system.bin and thus can be flashed with pyduml.py:
1.) micelwhave$ mkdir ./dji_system
2.) micelwhave$ gtar -cvf ~/dji_system.bin -C dji_system/ .

(I also made sure that in "https://extract.me" the structure of the new tarball looked exactly the very same like that of the original dji_system.bin tar.).
3.) Copy new tarball into same directory where pyduml.py resides.
4.) Now the new dji_system.bin can be flashed with pyduml as usual.

Tested with 01.04.0300, rooted RC, using gnu-tar via homebrew on a Mac.
